                        re-encryption schemes [2] in vehicular environments [1] is that each node needs to have a pair

                        intensive applications (e.g., Augmented Reality). However, a critical challenge emerged: how to

                    <td style="">The future connected vehicle network infrastructure will increase the pervasiveness of
                        the
                        Internet and the overall connectivity by integrating every object and forming an intelligent
                        transportation system (ITS) [1]. Examples of vehicular applications for such a promising
                        combination
                        ranges from providing assistance to drivers and road safety, to mapping road status and
                        multimedia
                        content sharing. Nevertheless, vehicles are more vulnerable than ever to hacking and data theft
                        as
                        they become smarter whether by being used as Wi-Fi connected hotspots or by being equipped with
                        millions of lines of code to be fully autonomous. The more connected a vehicle is, which is also
                        exacerbated by the recent increase in the number of connected vehicles, the more susceptible it
                        becomes to potentially deadly cyber-attacks [2].

                        If vehicle data streams are to be kept safe from attackers, they must be safeguarded with the
                        highest level of security available, e.g., Blockchain. Blockchain is a shared database that
                        exists
                        on multiple computers across a distributed network. It not only facilitates data storage, but
                        also
                        offers immutability, or protection against data being changed once it is stored in a block [3].
                        Blockchain also offers the following advantages: unparalleled security, transparency, and the
                        ability to audit records.

                        The goal of this project is to develop a blockchain-based secure data sharing system for
                        connected
                        vehicle networks hence securing connected vehicles' data by recording message exchanges among
                        vehicles in the form of immutable blocks stored in a distributed ledger.

                    <td style="">Classifying archaeological glass (or any archaeological material) is difficult at best.
                        Evaluating and interpreting the compositional data is currently done manually through an
                        iterative
                        process of simple statistical analyses to compare different sets of base glass components and
                        additives [1]. Archaeologists, art historians, conservators and museum curators alike rely on
                        pre-existing knowledge and the availability of comparative reference materials to identify and
                        classify vitreous materials. Similarly, reconstruction of ancient primary and secondary working
                        techniques is impeded by compositional and structural (colour, opacity) variability of
                        archaeological glass that may additionally have undergone alterations during burial. This means
                        that
                        much of the current ancient and medieval glass production model is based on assumptions derived
                        from
                        limited and incomplete data.

                        This project will investigate the capability of identifying patterns from complex,
                        multidimensional
                        datasets, using machine learning [2]. This has the potential to offer new insights into ancient
                        technological and historical processes, which gave rise to the different classes of materials
                        and
                        recipes. This project will investigate using self-supervised learning methods such as masked
                        autoencoding [3] or variational autoencoders[4] to build representations from partial
                        observations
                        using the dataset in [1]. This projects is in collaboration with Nadine Schibille (CNRS,

                    <td style="">Metacognition broadly refers to the ability to accurately reflect on one's own mental
                        states, and is important for adaptive behaviour because it enables us to identify our errors and
                        adapt our behaviour according to our uncertainty about our inferences. Mentalising (theory of

                        of their beliefs and knowledge, or lack thereof ("I changed my plans and am no longer free for
                        dinner - I should let my housemate know.").

                        <br>Recent work (1,2) has proposed that mentalising can be described in terms of hierarchical
                        bayesian inference, where the "sophistication" of a person's mentalising ability is the degree
                        of
                        recursive inference they can perform (e.g. "you think I think that the milk has gone off").

                        <br>The goal of this project is to take this model and adapt it to (pre-existing) human data
                        from
                        simple metacognitive tasks to test it against human performance on simple metacognitive tasks.

                    <td style="">The number of vehicles has been increasing due to the rapid development and
                        industrialization. This large number of vehicles has led to a significant number of issues such
                        as
                        traffic congestions, traffic accidents, and environmental pollution. The problem caused by an
                        increasing number of vehicles has led automotive manufacturers to use information and
                        communication
                        technology to improve users’ experience and safety by coordinating human, vehicle and the
                        environment [1]. Autonomous vehicles’ main goal is safety, comfort and the prompt delivery of
                        its
                        occupants with minimum impact on the environment [2]. These vehicles should also be able to
                        communicate with each other as well as with handheld devices carried by pedestrians, roadside
                        units,
                        and the public networks using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, which corresponds to the
                        Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A huge amount of data is also foreseen in IoV networks usually
                        driven by
                        the development of new vehicle applications such as vehicular telematics, infotainment, and
                        intelligent transportation services.

                        The security of an IoV network has been a major concern to researchers since it is an open
                        network
                        that anyone can join. Given the dynamic nature of IoVs, there is a need for data security to
                        prevent
                        malicious attacks such as denial of service (DoS), jamming, man in the middle, Sybil,
                        eavesdropping,
                        and broadcast and message tampering, which may lead to physical damages and privacy issues [3].
                        The
                        latter incentivized the researcher community to come up with different architectures.

                        Three possible cloud networks exist in IoVs, namely vehicular cloud, edge cloud, and Internet
                        cloud.
                        In a vehicular cloud, vehicles group themselves into clusters based on their geographical
                        locations.
                        A cluster head sends data to other cluster heads and to the edge cloud. These data can also be
                        sent
                        by the edge cloud to the Internet cloud for further processing. The cluster head is responsible
                        for
                        aggregating data sent by its vehicles, besides confirming its integrity. What if the cluster
                        head is
                        compromised?

                        The aim of this project is to design a novel smart monitoring system at the edge cloud to sense
                        malicious behaviors such as DoS attacks, identity spoofing attacks, and data spoofing in the
                        vehicle
                        cloud. The system will be a lightweight machine learning algorithm placed at the edge to analyze
                        network traffic. The algorithm should be trained to learn normal network functioning and detect
                        anomalies (e.g., [4]).

                    <td style="">The classical MNIST data set of handwritten digits [1] has long been a standard
                        benchmark
                        in machine learning. For the domain of spiking neural networks (SNNs) there is a new variety of
                        this
                        data, the neuromorphic MNIST (N-MNIST) data set [2]. This new data set was generated by moving
                        an
                        event-based camera in front of the MNIST digits, so creating event streams that contain the
                        information of what digit was seen. The proposed project is to use our existing implementations
                        of
                        modern gradient-based methods for training SNNs (so-called e-prop [3] or so-called EventProp [4]
                        learning rules) to attempt classifying N-MNIST and benchmarking performance.

                    <td style="">Can attention be utilised to flexibly alternate between generative and discriminative
                        learning? Biological models of learning based on energy-minimisation (e.g. Hopfield networks
                        [1],
                        predictive coding networks [2]) are appealing due to their connections to physical systems and
                        Bayesian inference. However, attempting to use such models for discriminative learning (e.g.
                        classification) often results in poor performance, possibly due to interference effects in the
                        network. On the other hand, large language models, which employ an attention mechanism [3], are
                        able
                        to perform a wide range of tasks. Our recent work shows that the attention mechanism can be
                        thought
                        of as probabilistic switching between different network architectures given an input. The
                        project
                        will build upon this idea to create an energy-minimisation based model that flexibly switches
                        between generative and discriminative learning. Such a system would represent a huge step
                        forward in
                        our understanding of flexible biological learning, at the same time shedding light on the
                        pivotal
                        role of attention in artificial neural networks.

                    <td style="">What kind of computations naturally emerge in physical material?. In his seminal work
                        John
                        Hopfield pointed out the deep analogy between the dynamics of neural networks and an abstract
                        model
                        of ferromagnetic materials and this has formed a central workhorse to describe computations such
                        as
                        Bayesian inference and combinatorial optimization in physical systems [1]. In this project will
                        consider the same question but in different physical media, in particular viscoelastic materials
                        modeled as networks of mass-spring dampers [2] . We will ask what kind of computation naturally
                        emerges in these materials and in particular to what extent they can be used to solve
                        combinatorial
                        optimization problems [3,4]. The project will shed light evolutionary origins of computation as
                        well
                        as point the way to the construction of smart materials.

                        students can interact with the system in order explore its capacities and hence understand the
                        magnitude of the achievement of that early work. Here are two options:
                        1) Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist was one of the first "thinking machines". It rediscovered
                        most
                        of the theorems of propositional logic that Whitehead and Russell published. Here is the paper:

                        You may use any programming language with which you are familiar, but the CLIPS rule-base
                        programming language would be particularly suitable: <a href="http://www.clipsrules.net"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.clipsrules.net</a> .
                        2) Brian Funt's Whisper system is a classic problem solving systems from early in AI, that
                        reasons
                        over a visual representation. Whisper solves problems about moving blocks by using an ingenious
                        simulated eye. The original Whisper paper is available from the library: Funt, Brian (1980),
                        Problem-solving with diagrammatic representations. Artificial Intelligence, 1980, Vol.13(3),
                        pp.201-230.

                    <td style="">Over the past decade, Deep neural networks have achieved highly impressive perceptual
                        feats. In particular, convolutional neural networks have surpassed humans in their ability to
                        classify naturalistic images. These findings, together with their similarities in architecture
                        and
                        activity patterns, have sparked major renewed interest in DNNs as models of the brain. However,
                        these models diverge from human perceptual abilities in important and unexpected ways, e.g.,
                        through
                        their weakness to noise, susceptibility to adversarial attacks and inability to recognise
                        stylised
                        representations. This has been shown to be due to their over-reliance on diagnostic but brittle
                        features such as texture [1] or even a single pixel correlated with the image class [2]. Some of
                        these shortcomings have been addressed through incorporating more of the properties of the
                        primate
                        visual system into these models [3] or by using more extensive and naturalistic training regimes
                        [4].

                        The aim of this project is to improve upon [3] by optimising the bank of Gabor filters for
                        standard
                        image classification benchmarks while retaining the advantages of generalisation. This could
                        include
                        augmenting the network with additional features such as internal noise [5], a retinal
                        (information)
                        bottleneck [6] or recurrent connections.

                    <td style="">The backpropagation (BP) of error algorithm is the workhorse of all modern deep
                        learning,
                        yet as Francis Crick famously pointed out, it is unlikely that the brain could implement
                        something
                        like BP by propagating some global error through layers. This has led to a variety of
                        biologically
                        inspired algorithms that update synaptic weights by using only locally available information.
                        Nevertheless, despite this encouraging progress, almost all these algorithms struggle to solve
                        large-scale tasks, which prevents them from being deployed in real-world applications. This
                        project
                        will attempt to scale a recently proposed algorithm called “hybrid predictive coding” (HPC, <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02169" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02169</a>), which improves the
                        efficiency
                        of previous predictive coding schemes by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Inspired by psychology and
                        neuroscience research, HPC implements a fast feedforward pass that computes a “best guess” of
                        the
                        input and a slower iterative inference process that refines the initial belief. In practice, the
                        project will involve extensive experimentation with architectures, optimisers, and datasets in
                        PyTorch, which the student is expected to be familiar with.</td>

                    <td style="">Monitoring, understanding, and predicting the integrity of our planetary biosphere is
                        the
                        most critical sustainability issue of our time. The emerging science of Bioacoustics focuses on
                        investigating and differentiating between audio signals emitted by individuals and inferring
                        behavioural information from intra- and interspecific signals. This project will investigate how
                        cutting edge machine learning systems can learn to detect and identify anuran (frog) species in
                        audio soundscape representations. This will include exploration of preprocessing and learning
                        strategies, architectures and inductive biases and capabilities for ecological monitoring and
                        prediction.
                        This project is in collaboration with Kieran Gibb and Ivor Simpson and feeds into existing
                        research
                        at Sussex into cutting edge research in learning ecologically meaningful soundscape
                        representations
                        for inference. This builds on recent work using unsupervised methods for bird classification [1]
                        applying similar techniques to a Sussex collected dataset [5].

                        The objective of this project will be to investigate approaches to event detection and
                        segmentation
                        for the classification of frog species within a sparsely labelled audio dataset using
                        variational
                        auto-encoders, contrastive learning or other unsupervised learning approaches.

                        colourimetric image properties are known to predict ratings of aesthetic preference for images
                        (e.g.
                        Kardan et al., 2015; Mather, 2020). However, models of average preference are limited by some
                        individual differences in rating behaviour that can be reduced to some extent to clusters of
                        rater
                        types (Spehar, Walker and Taylor, 2016). In collaboration with researchers in the School of
                        Psychology, this project will develop the established methods of modelling ratings of aesthetic
                        preference for images aiming to reliably explain the most variance in preference ratings.
                        Several
                        datasets of individual preference ratings of various image types are available (e.g. of natural
                        scenes, artworks) and these include some data about characteristics of the individual raters.
                        One
                        potential avenue to explore includes improving models of aesthetic preferences e.g. by
                        overcoming
                        issues of correlated predictor variables via dimensionality reduction techniques. The project
                        may
                        also tackle the issue of individual differences by developing machine learning models of
                        aesthetic
                        value of images that factor individual traits into account, guided by contemporary theories in
                        cognitive psychology e.g. greater levels of autistic traits may lead to a greater reliance on
                        low-level image properties in sensory processing.

                        <p>In cognitive neuroscience, a popular approach to studying how certain perceptual decisions
                            are
                            made is to fit a computational model to behavioural data and search for neural activity that
                            correlates to those fitted parameters.
                        </p>

                        <p>In a recent paper on time perception [1] we took a different approach, building on co-author
                            Dr
                            Roseboom's previous theoretical work to construct model-based predictions of subjective time
                            from the brain activity itself and asking whether those correlate whether behavioural
                            reports.
                            In this way, rather than assuming that some specific brain region or neural activity is
                            coding
                            for some researcher-created model parameter, we started from the uncontroversial assumption
                            that
                            brain activity in sensory regions is the basis for visual inference, and then from there
                            used
                            the model to test whether it predicts human behaviour well.</p>

                        <p>This project will take the same approach, applying it to subjective confidence reports on
                            visual
                            decisions. The project will use previously collected neuroimaging data, acquired while
                            participants performed a simple perceptual task (reporting the presence or absence of a
                            faint
                            grating) and gave subjective confidence reatings [2]. The project will involve extending a
                            few
                            simple decision making models to account for confidence reports, and then generate model
                            predictions that use visual cortex activity to test those brain-based models against human
                            behaviour. This will constitute a stronger test of whether the computational models are
                            capturing something similar to what the brain is doing when it evaluates decision
                            (un)certainty.

                        The task is to create software to read and process cooking or baking recipes in natural
                        language, so
                        as to identify information about ingredients and temporal processing steps, in line with the
                        requirements of recipe decomposition for CMD process modelling (see <a
                            href="http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~rrg21/files/Grau+Cheng(2013)%20The%20Support%20of%20Higher-level%20Cognition%20in%20the%20Context%20of%20Ill-structured%20Process%20Knowledge.pdf"

                        In domains like food-production, modelling the processes underlying many complex products is an
                        ill-structured problem. One approach to manage the complexity of the modelling task is to
                        exploit
                        the algorithm-like properties of a production recipe to identify relevant information about the
                        physical and temporal structure of a process. In the domain of baking, for example, we can
                        identify
                        ingredients as they are added to a compound, and also any induced changes in the processing of
                        these
                        ingredients. While domain experts can usually describe at good levels of detail particular
                        fragments
                        of process knowledge at a specific level of abstraction, it can be very difficult to
                        interconnect
                        these fragments to form a more comprehensive model. To achieve this, a well-defined barebone
                        model
                        of physical components and temporal stages can help to attach different model fragments and
                        inspect
                        their contents in relation to each other. It also provides pointers to areas of process
                        interaction
                        that haven't been modelled yet. For example, consider the following illustration of a simple
                        pound
                        cake recipe and how it could be mapped into a compound diagram:
                        <img src="http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~rrg21/images/cd.png" alt="cd.png">

                        Currently, recipe decomposition is a task that must be performed manually by domain experts or
                        knowledge engineers at the beginning of the modelling process.
                        The idea behind this project is that a suitable NLP program could perform this task
                        automatically,
                        given ordinary text recipes. Obviously, there is a challenge here in that the recipes may
                        contain
                        relevant information encoded in statements that are vague or qualitative in nature.

                        <p>Metacognition is the ability reflect on one's internal states, and this includes the ability
                            to
                            evaluate the accuracy or efficacy of our own decisions or inferences: do we know when we
                            made a
                            good versus bad choice? In the lab, metacognition in this sense is often measured by using
                            simple (and dull) tasks such as discriminating the motion direction of a dot cloud,
                            collecting
                            subjective confidence ratings with each decision, and looking for correspondences between
                            confidence and choice accuracy.</p>

                        <p>In the board game Confident?, players answer trivia questions such as "How many hours a week
                            does
                            the average Brit watch Netflix?" by reporting a range of values they think the answer lies
                            in.
                            The round is won by the player who reports the narrowest range that includes the correct
                            answer.
                            There are also bonus cards which can occasionally be used, which allow you to either swap
                            your
                            answer with another player, or to double the points you will receive.</p>

                        <p>This game is an interesting toy model for metacognition in group settings: players need to
                            evaluate the uncertainty about our inferences, but they also learn about the
                            knowledge/performance of others and have the option to defer responses to them (the switch
                            cards). Therefore, reward maximisation in this game requires learning over iterations both
                            one's
                            own metacognitive ability, and that of one's opponents. </p>

                        <p>The aim of this project is to adapt this board game into an online multiplayer experiment.
                            Then,
                            depending on your interests, you could, for example:

                            <li>collect some behavioural data and analyse/model participants' responses to see how
                                metacognitive choices evolve with game iterations</li>

                        With
                        the rapid development of 5G communication systems, the advancements of vehicular communication
                        technology in assisting Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can effectively improve
                        passengers’
                        safety and provide infotainment for enjoyable journeys [1]. There have been significant
                        advancements
                        in electronics aiding car drivers, along with communications outside the vehicle, e.g.,
                        vehicle-to-
                        everything (V2X), to enable mobile Internet and entertainment. Together with V2X connectivity,
                        data
                        collected from infrastructure Road Side Units and various other sensors placed on roads,
                        buildings
                        and pedestrians, which constitute the next-generation vehicular networks, hereafter Internet of
                        Vehicles (IoVs), could be disseminated to the vehicle cloud hence ensuring efficient emergency
                        warning notifications, the management of the city traffic levels, and provide drivers with
                        congestion control information.

                        However, security is a key challenge in ITS for IoVs since, nowadays, there exist a plethora of
                        security attacks that can negatively impact its reliability [2]. Some examples of common threats
                        to
                        vehicles in ITS include denial of service, jamming, man in the middle, Sybil, eavesdropping, and
                        broadcast and message tampering.

                        When further investigating individual behaviors and by considering that each vehicle or group of
                        vehicles is controlled by a rational entity, vehicles might misbehave (maliciously or not) by
                        reporting false safety messages while using valid security credentials, what is critical for the
                        most ITS-based applications [3]. This problem is further exacerbated by the absence or
                        impracticality of centralized control in vehicular environments. Conventional incentive schemes
                        allow nodes to learn from their surroundings, i.e., from neighboring vehicles, and then assess
                        the
                        veracity of reported events and the honesty of vehicles. However, these schemes have their own
                        vulnerabilities, such as false accusations and praise, which can be exploited to manipulate the
                        entire network for the benefit of malicious vehicles/entities.

                        The aim of this project is to design a novel AI-based incentive framework by considering social
                        norm
                        complexity and past reputations [4] to improve cooperation among nodes.

                        <p>This project considers methods for the problem of measuring the similarity of two sentences.
                            There are two dominant approaches both of which involve the use of a BERT (or RoBERTa)
                            masked
                            language model: cross-encoders and bi-encoders.</p>

                        <p>Cross-encoders generally achieved higher performance than bi-encoders improvements on various
                            sentence pair tasks. However, an asymmetry issue arises from the fact that cross-encoder
                            involve
                            sentence concatenation in its input scheme. The issue is that this has the potential to
                            violate
                            the reasonable assumption that sentence order should not have an impact on a measure of
                            sentence
                            similarity. This is an issue that is not discussed in recent work involving the use of
                            cross-encoders </p>

                        <p>In this project, you will explore methods that relax the asymmetry constraint in BERT
                            (RoBERTa)
                            cross-encoders, in particular, attempt to decreases the percentage of inconsistent
                            predictions
                            while maintaining the overall performance. For example, you could try to make modifications
                            to
                            BERT(RoBERTa)’s structure such as changes its positional embedding.</p>

                        <p>
                            Scientific instruments played a key role in the intellectual and industrial endeavours and
                            developments of British history, from the sixteenth century to the twentieth. Over this
                            extended
                            historical period, how these instruments were understood and referred to, in diverse kinds
                            of
                            published texts, changed significantly. This MSc project will set out to identify the
                            appearance
                            of references in historical corpora and to trace some aspect(s) of these changes. </p>

                        <p>Access will be available, for each student, to one of the following: a medium scale corpus of
                            mixed texts from pre-1700 and eighteenth century (English language); a large corpus of
                            nineteenth century medical texts (multiple European languages but primarily English); the
                            Hansard record of parliamentary debate. These will enable such questions as: how the ideas
                            of
                            ‘compass’ or ‘microscope’ were used literally or figuratively; in what contexts were
                            scientific
                            measurement referenced in Parliament; how were names invented to refer to new kinds of
                            instruments and what new processes were they associated with in nineteenth century medical
                            texts?</p>


                        <b>Background </b>
                        <p>
                            ‘Tools of Knowledge: modelling the communities of scientific instrument makers in Britain,
                            1550-1914’ is a thirty-month-long AHRC-funded project that began in early 2020. It is a
                            collaboration between the University of Sussex (Dr Alex Butterworth), which is leading on
                            the
                            data processing and digital interpretation, the Department of History and Philosophy of
                            Science
                            at the University of Cambridge and the National Museum of Scotland, with the National
                            Maritime
                            Museum, Greenwich as a partner organisation. </p>

                        <p>The project is creating a semantically modelled database of over ten thousand named
                            instrument
                            makers and businesses, their family and professional relationships with other individuals
                            and
                            institutions, together with the thousands of instruments - historical ‘tools of knowledge’ -
                            made by them that still exist in museums. It is drawing on a wide range of written and
                            visual
                            sources and collections data, and applying many different computational methods - new ‘tools
                            of
                            knowledge’ - to extract, model, analyse and interpret. It aims to generate transformative
                            insights into an area of activity crucial to the changing intellectual, industrial and
                            commercial life of Britain over several centuries. </p>

                        <p>The project is intended to enable new research at all levels, and offers a number of MSc

                    <td style="">
                        <p>In a wide variety of NLP applications, the need arises to create one or more bespoke document
                            classifiers. For example, suppose that you want analyse the conversation on Twitter
                            concerned
                            with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. A first step would be to identify a set of
                            search
                            terms that could be used to collect a reasonable sample of this conversation. A typical
                            second
                            step would involve the creation of a (relevancy) document classifier that is intended to
                            filter
                            out tweets that contain one the search terms, but which are not relevant to the conversation
                            being targeted (perhaps because the matching search term was ambiguous). Once a (mostly)
                            relevant set of documents (tweets) has been assembled, it is common to create a further
                            document
                            classifier (or collection of classifiers) that attempt to divide up the dataset according to
                            which of a number of identifiable sub-topics the documents (tweets) are concerned with. As
                            this
                            example illustrates, this kind of scenario is likely to require the creation of a number of
                            bespoke document classifiers: i.e. classification problems for which no suitable labelled
                            data
                            exists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            State-of-the-art classifiers are currently built using very large pre-trained masked
                            language
                            models (e.g. BERT), and to achieve high performance this typically involves the use of
                            several
                            thousand labelled examples.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project you will explore active learning methods that can be used to produce
                            classifiers
                            with reasonable performance, with a 10's, or 100's of labelled examples. Active learning
                            methods
                            are algorithms that iteratively select the most useful documents to labelled at each
                            iteration.

                        <p>
                            The methods under consideration would be evaluated on a wide variety of datasets involving
                            different types of document classification, such as sentiment analysis, and topic-based

                    <td style="">'Tensors' are multidimensional arrays which can be 'multiplied' together (in the same
                        way
                        that matrices can be multiplied together). Interesting and difficult problems can be represented
                        straightforwardly as a multiplication problem for tensors, using by a graph-like structure
                        called a
                        ‘tensor network’. The difficulty is that, unlike ‘normal’ matrix multiplications, the
                        intermediate
                        results of evaluating tensor networks may require much, much more computation and memory the
                        size of
                        the input data.

                        The aim of this project is to write a program to evaluate a tensor network with integer
                        coefficients, from a simple input specification of a graph-like structure, with the aim of
                        determining whether the result is likely to be zero, or certainly non-zero. The code should
                        perform
                        efficiently enough (in terms of speed and memory resources) to allow it to be tested on
                        moderately
                        difficult problems.

                        This project is likely to involve some research into (pre-existing) graph algorithms, and may
                        involve some very light modular arithmetic (evaluation of addition and multiplication mod N).

                        autoencoders [2], their hierarchical derivatives [3] or contrastive learning [4]. We will use

                            and the stories of the instruments they made, and to model and analyse these as data.
                            Examples
                            of these events might be: when and where was a person educated or involved in a legal

                            collector? The task, therefore, is to Identify likely events (as entity-graph structures) in
                            digitised corpora collected for the current research projects, indexed to controlled

                        <p>A student working on this MSc project will be provided with a number of small to medium-sized
                            corpora and may choose to work with any or all of them. These comprise (a) Six digitised

                        <b>Background </b>

                        <p>‘Tools of Knowledge: modelling the communities of scientific instrument makers in Britain,
                            1550-1914’ is an thirty-month-long AHRC-funded project that began in early 2020. It is a
                            collaboration between the University of Sussex (Dr Alex Butterworth), which is leading on
                            the
                            data processing and digital interpretation, the Department of History and Philosophy of
                            Science
                            at the University of Cambridge and the National Museum of Scotland, with the National
                            Maritime
                            Museum, Greenwich as a partner organisation. </p>

                        <p>The project is creating a semantically modelled database of over ten thousand named
                            instrument
                            makers and businesses, their family and professional relationships with other individuals
                            and
                            institutions, together with the thousands of instruments - historical ‘tools of knowledge’ -
                            made by them that still exist in museums. It is drawing on a wide range of written and
                            visual
                            sources and collections data, and applying many different computational methods - new ‘tools
                            of
                            knowledge’ - to extract, model, analyse and interpret. It aims to generate transformative
                            insights into an area of activity crucial to the changing intellectual, industrial and
                            commercial life of Britain over several centuries. </p>

                        <p>The project is intended to enable new research at all levels, and offers ta number of MSc
                            students of AI/Data Science at Sussex an early opportunity to explore some of the materials
                            with
                            which we are working, using data science methods to address real project needs.

                    <td style="">The Dreamachine was a large-scale art science exhibit that toured the UK last year that
                        was
                        designed to explore the extraordinary potential of the mind [1]. Triggered solely by strobe
                        lights
                        and music, vivid kaleidoscopic patterns and explosions of colour are experienced in the mind of
                        the
                        viewer – this is an artwork that is experienced with your eyes closed. Every individual
                        experiences
                        something different, and this is intriguing to neuroscientists studying the workings of the
                        mind,
                        human perception, and the inner differences in how people view the world. This project will
                        apply
                        machine learning to data gathered from visitors to the Dreamachine, to search for patterns and
                        possible classifications of people’s experiences. We have over 10,000 scanned coloured images
                        created by visitors recreating their experiences. Algorithms could be run on this data set
                        searching
                        for clusters of similar types of experience and/or encoders could be used to parametrise
                        individual
                        experiences. One might also search for differences between low intensity and high intensity
                        Dreamachine shows. One could also make use of additional questionnaire data or do some
                        processing/analytics on hand-written descriptions of experiences. The project will involve
                        collaborating with a group of researchers at the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science.

                        <b>Background </b>

                        <p>‘Tools of Knowledge: modelling the communities of scientific instrument makers in Britain,
                            1550-1914’ is a thirty-month-long AHRC-funded project that began in early 2020. It is a
                            collaboration between the University of Sussex (Dr Alex Butterworth), which is leading on
                            the
                            data processing and digital interpretation, the Department of History and Philosophy of
                            Science
                            at the University of Cambridge and the National Museum of Scotland, with the National
                            Maritime
                            Museum, Greenwich as a partner organisation. </p>

                        <p>The project is creating a semantically modelled database of over ten thousand named
                            instrument
                            makers and businesses, their family and professional relationships with other individuals
                            and
                            institutions, together with the thousands of instruments - historical ‘tools of knowledge’ -
                            made by them that still exist in museums. It is drawing on a wide range of written and
                            visual
                            sources and collections data, and applying many different computational methods - new ‘tools
                            of
                            knowledge’ - to extract, model, analyse and interpret. It aims to generate transformative
                            insights into an area of activity crucial to the changing intellectual, industrial and
                            commercial life of Britain over several centuries. </p>

                        <p>The project is intended to enable new research at all levels, and a number of MSc students of
                            AI/Data Science at Sussex an early opportunity to explore some of the materials with which
                            we
                            are working, using data science methods to address real project needs. </p>

                        <p>There is a great deal of interest in the data science community in algorithms that construct
                            and
                            analyse social networks. This project will be concerned with building a tool that can be

                            visualise and explore such networks in various ways.</p>

                        <p>The underlying data from which the network is produced may be derived from social-networks,
                            but
                            ideally the tool will be agnostic to any specific domain of data. The tool may be built as a
                            interactive counterpart to existing network processing libraries (e.g. NetworkX in python).
                        </p>

                        <p>Such tooling will aim to facilitate the exploration of “communities” or “clusters” present in
                            network structure, with functionality to, for example:

                            <li>Show node and edge annotations (e.g. through the use of textual labels, colours, sizes)
                            </li>
                            <li>Highlight differences between changing network structures (e.g. across time)</li>
                            <li>Adjust the layout/position of nodes and edges (e.g. through the use of existing layout
                                algorithms such as ForceAtlas)</li>
                            <li>Submit edits/annotations made to the network for processing and (re)visualise the
                                result.

                    <td style="">
                        <p>In a wide variety of NLP applications, the need arises to create one or more bespoke document
                            classifiers. For example, suppose that you want analyse the conversation on Twitter
                            concerned
                            with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. A first step would be to identify a set of
                            search
                            terms that could be used to collect a reasonable sample of this conversation. A typical
                            second
                            step would involve the creation of a (relevancy) document classifier that is intended to
                            filter
                            out tweets that contain one the search terms, but which are not relevant to the conversation
                            being targeted (perhaps because the matching search term was ambiguous). Once a (mostly)
                            relevant set of documents (tweets) has been assembled, it is common to create a further
                            document
                            classifier (or collection of classifiers) that attempt to divide up the dataset according to
                            which of a number of identifiable sub-topics the documents (tweets) are concerned with. As
                            this
                            example illustrates, this kind of scenario is likely to require the creation of a number of
                            bespoke document classifiers: i.e. classification problems for which no suitable labelled
                            data
                            exists. </p>

                        <p>State-of-the-art classifiers are currently built using very large pre-trained masked language
                            models (e.g. BERT), and to achieve high performance this typically involves the use of
                            several
                            thousand labelled examples.</p>

                        <p>In this project you will explore data augmentation methods that can be used to produce
                            classifiers with reasonable performance, with a tens, or hundreds of labelled examples. Data
                            augmentation methods are algorithms that expand (augment) a (potentially small) set of
                            labelled
                            instances by generating new labelled instances based on various heuristics. For example,
                            rephrasing sentences in a document in ways that are presumed not to change the document's
                            label.
                            Data augmentation techniques that could be explored include simple approaches such as
                            swapping
                            words, to the use of generation model such as AUG-BERT.</p>

                        <p>The methods under consideration would be evaluated on a wide variety of datasets involving
                            different types of document classification, such as sentiment analysis, and topic-based
                            classification.</p>

                    <td style="">There are many scenarios where there is a need to extend the coverage of an existing
                        set of textual documents (seed documents) that are a sample of those documents you are
                        interested in. For example, you might have a seed collection consisting of 100 examples of web
                        pages advertising the sale of protected wildlife products (pangolin scales), and want to track
                        down further examples; or you might have a seed collection of 1000 social media posts where
                        someone has expressed hatred towards some group, and wish to use these as the basis for setting
                        up a search for additional examples.

                        In such situations, it can be useful to use the seed document set in order to identify a set of
                        words and phrases that are distinctive of the seed documents (e.g. because they appear
                        surprisingly often when compared to their 'expected' frequency), with a view to using the
                        distinctive words/phrases as search terms that can be used to retrieve additional documents of
                        interest.

                        The University of Sussex TAG Lab develops applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for
                        problems such the one described above, and we have built a tool called the "Surprisingly
                        Frequent Phrase Detector" (SFPD) which is designed to address the challenge outlined above. In
                        this project, you would explore a number of ideas that we have as to how to improve the SFPD.
                        This will include an investigation into the way that we expand surprising words into surprising
                        phrases.

                        research. While there have been many success stories in various individual projects based on
                        recent advances in using deep learning for DIA, many of these required specialised training or
                        post-processing steps to achieve satisfactory performances. The goal is to make use of a
                        recently proposed uniform framework for DIA [1] to develop a semi-automated workflow for exam

                        known) possible layouts.

                    <td style="">Many researchers have worked on the formal verification of real-time systems, but very
                        few practical tools are readily available; one of the reasons is that most problems in this area
                        are undecidable. However, if one focus instead on bounded time domains (which presumably is
                        sufficient for many practical purposes, e.g., the system runs correctly within the first 30
                        seconds), then most of the problems become decidable. Still, there haven’t been any
                        implementations of these algorithms. The goal is to look into the relevant techniques, how can
                        they be implemented, whether they can satisfactory capture real benchmarks, and evaluate the
                        performance of the prototype.

                    <td style="">Programming languages are not reversible in general; however, there are well-known
                        approaches to make them reversible, e.g., by storing computation histories or checkpointing.
                        Another successful approach is based on designing restricted languages where all the commands
                        are reversible. This project is about implementing an alternative approach where we do not
                        restrict the language. Instead, we design a mechanism to obtain reversibility at both language
                        level and computation level by using novel ideas inspired by control flow approaches to
                        reversibility.

                        This project involves some background reading followed by implementation work.

                        be described as follows: given a growing trace of behaviour (e.g., network activity log) and a
                        specification (e.g., an ack can surely be found within 10 seconds after each req), can we
                        construct a monitor that signals immediately when the trace of behaviour violates the
                        specification? Again, since the size of the growing trace is unbounded, the monitor must handle
                        it without storing the whole of it. The goal of this project is to survey the existing
                        approaches, understand their strengths/weaknesses, and implement a prototype tool that
                        allows this kind of online monitoring of traces with timestamps and real-time specifications.

                        A good starting point is the following paper:

                    <td style="">Insights into the dynamics of economic crises can come about from agent-based
                        modelling. Simple models can be built consisting of networks of firms producing goods, financed
                        by a network of credit providers (banks). Most economic models assume endless growth, but in
                        this era of climate change, some models are starting to explore what happens if growth stops.
                        The starting point for this project is a model that a previous student is currently writing up,
                        which was designed to explore the distribution of fortunes of businesses during both endless
                        growth and 'limits to growth' scenarios. This project will explore possible variations to the
                        model and analyses that can be run with it. Analyses could compare the frequency and severity of
                        economic crises in situations with and without ecological constraints on growth. Paper [1] gives
                        a recent review of agent-based macroeconomics. For a purely macro aggregated analysis of
                        zero-growth economics, see my paper [2].

                    <td style="">There are many simple models often used to describe human behaviour, and link with
                        potential neural processes underlying behaviour. For example, in recent decades it has become
                        very common to describe how humans combine information from sound and vision (such as audio and
                        visual components of speech) using simple Bayesian models (<a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1038/415429a" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1038/415429a</a>). Despite these approaches
                        becoming very common, most people use bespoke programming, often in proprietary environments
                        like Matlab to implement their models, and this work is not usually shared in accordance with
                        normal open/transparent science goals. Additionally, many people working in human behaviour lack
                        the skills to implement such models themselves, meaning that they can’t examine whether such
                        simple explanations exist in their data, often leading to overly complex interpretations being
                        unnecessarily published or propagated in the literature. The idea would be to develop a simple
                        and intuitive web-based interface where researchers could upload their own raw behavioural data
                        (in some relatively standardised format) and, through a simple GUI, examine whether simple
                        models replicate the relevant aspects of their data. Alternatively (or in addition), could be
                        deployed as Jupyter notebooks. There are many models with increasing complexity beyond simple
                        Bayesian models described above – similar kind of model but through time (~Kalman filter),
                        causal inference structure models, drift diffusion models, etc – that are applied to different
                        cases. The depth of sophistication in modelling and aspects of UX will be up to your skills and
                        creativity in deployment, with the core goal of the project being very simple, but it being
                        extendable to more interesting and increasingly complex models/interfaces. Ideally, can also do
                        validation against existing results to show operation. There is the possibility for several
                        distinct student projects deploying different modelling approaches.</td>

                        of biological (particularly human/primate) vision, “illusions” or other failures in performance
                        (e.g. “crowding”; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_crowding" target="_blank"

                        studied as edge cases to potentially help understand how the visual system works. From an
                        engineering viewpoint, the correspondence in both what the different systems (machine or
                        biological vision) are good at doing, as well as what they are similarly impaired by, is
                        potentially of great relevance for understanding the basis of effective computer vision. From a
                        position of basic science, such work may be relevant to understanding the foundations of
                        biological vision. The idea would be to compare and contrast the performance of some standard
                        image classification networks and their susceptibility to particular adversarial attacks, with
                        some focus on the kinds of “attacks” that cause human vision to make mistakes (illusions,

                    <td style="">This project aims to develop a blockchain-based game that establishes an economy
                        through tokenisation.

                        Blockchains allow for the secure and seamless transfer of publicly auditable assets, an ability
                        the technology achieves without relying upon any form of centralisation. The result is that a
                        blockchain has particular relevance to finance because it can help reduce the cost of financial
                        services by improving payment transparency, efficiency, trust, and security. Consequently, many
                        of the first real-world applications of blockchains have focused on decentralised finance.
                        However, recently, there has been an increasing interest in blockchains in gaming because
                        tokenisation provides a way to introduce finance into that world. This project looks to explore
                        that relationship.

                        can be
                        more faithfully modelled/represented by allowing occurrence times to be arbitrary real or

                        numbers (e.g., something happens at 4.289 seconds from now). While most problems are undecidable
                        in that setting when a reasonably expressive specification language is allowed, recent results
                        identified
                        several useful fragments for which the timeline-based planning problem is decidable. The goal is

                    <td style="">Background: Quantitative light microscopy is an integral part of experimental cell
                        biology. Despite the rapid progress in imaging technology and computer vision, large scale
                        automated analysis of microscopy data still faces many challenges due to the diversity of cell
                        appearance and poor signal to noise ratio. Segmentation (labelling pixels as being part of the
                        same object, or same object class) is an important part of tracking algorithms. This requires
                        robust and accurate quantification of cell shape. A difficulty with segmentation is the amount
                        of human pixel-level labelling required to get good results, and this effort needs to be
                        repeated for different cell lines to cope with varying appearance.

                        Objectives: This technical project will utilise machine learning to improve the performance of
                        cell segmentation with fewer labelled examples. This will be achieved using a combination of
                        state-of-the-art semi-supervised pre-training [1][2] and plausible data augmentations [3] with
                        segmentation model architectures[4]. Alternative approaches could include few-shot learning
                        methods [5].

                        This interdisciplinary project will be jointly supervised by Ivor Simpson (Informatics) and
                        Helfrid Hochegger (Life Sciences)

                    <td style="">'Tensors' are multidimensional arrays which can be 'multiplied' together (in the same
                        way that matrices can be multiplied together). Interesting and difficult problems can be
                        represented straightforwardly as a multiplication problem for tensors, using by a graph-like
                        structure called a ‘tensor network’.

                        The aim of this project is to define a simple programming language which specifies a tensor
                        network, and a program (either an interpreter or a compiler) to read this language and compute
                        the result. The program does not have to evaluate the results very *quickly*, though simple
                        attempts to help the program perform well are desirable.

                        The interface of the program may be either text-based (interactive shell or static text file) or
                        visual as you prefer. It may 'compile' subroutines to help speed up computation, or evaluate
                        every expression from scratch each time. The language and/or other interfaces which you are to
                        design should be simple, at least for people with the appropriate background.

                        I will be happy to suggest simple (or if you like, not-so-simple) techniques to perform the
                        evaluation which may help your program evaluate the tensor networks. I can also offer
                        suggestions which may help in the design of the language itself. If you have interesting ideas
                        about how to provide the programmer with more control / better performance in evaluating the
                        tensor network, I am happy to advise or provide feedback.</td>

                        costs, e.g. per particle, and for swimmer bodies of varying complexity.

                        verification tool for real-time systems modelled as timed automata, but it only supports a very
                        limited
                        specification language. Recent efforts have extended this support to specifications written in
                        MITL
                        (Metric Interval Temporal Logic) by introducing an extra translation from the latter into timed
                        automata. An alternative to MITL with different specification style is ECL (Event-Clock Logic),
                        which
                        is computationally cheaper and thus more suitable for practical use, but it is not supported by
                        existing tools. The goal is to follow the translation approach, i.e. develop a translator from
                        ECL into
                        timed automata as required by Uppaal. This will involve lexing and parsing of ECL formulas and
                        processing of XML files.

                    <td style="">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been demonstrated as a powerful and flexible
                        technique for understanding the human brain. In recent years large scale studies, such as the
                        Human Connectome Project (HCP)[1], have identified acquisition protocols to allow consistent
                        high-quality data collection and preprocessing [2][3]. This preprocessing creates a set of
                        measurements, which describe individual anatomical and functional properties.

                        This project seeks to develop a framework for identifying biomarkers [4], patterns of
                        measurements that are indicative of a particular condition, from pre-processed HCP data.
                        Specifically, this project will explore how different machine learning analysis strategies can
                        be used to extract biomarkers, with the added goal of identifying approaches that robustly
                        detect interpretable differences between populations. A student on this project will have access
                        to HCP data from people with synaesthesia (unusual experiences such as music triggering vision)
                        which could be compared to normative samples or clinical data from other sources. The student
                        could either run a pre-planned analysis or search the literature to develop an alternative
                        biomarker.


                        This interdisciplinary project will be jointly supervised by Ivor Simpson (Informatics) and
                        Jamie Ward (Psychology).

                    <td style="">There is a great deal of interest in modelling the way that various kinds of
                        information flows through a social network (SN). Such models can be used to explain how the
                        views being expressed by members of a SN percolate to other members of the network; who the key
                        influences are that are spreading particular kinds of views, and how the users within the
                        network can be clustered into groups that are influenced by the same set of influencers.

                        Once such a model has been built, it is typically the case that the most effective way to
                        interrogate the model is through interaction with a visualisation. The goal of this project is
                        to create such an interactive tool using Gephi, iGraph, or some other appropriate network

                        Project Description Nowadays making security decisions is a common everyday task that most of
                        working or studying with computers people facing. For instance, answering the following
                        questions becomes common: Shell I plug this USB stick into my computer? Shell I connect to this
                        public Wi-Fi? Trust plays significant role in all these scenarios. In this project, the ways to
                        model trust and assist in such decisions are explored by combining existing decision analysis
                        models with developed in this project trust models. The developed decision aiding system is
                        supposed to analyse all available information and suggest the decision maker a solution optimal
                        from security and trust points of view. For instance trust can be studied in the context of
                        phishing: why some people trust phishing emails and fall victims of social engineering.
                        Project Outline
                        Study everyday decision scenarios and existing trust models. Develop trust models for selected
                        scenario(s).
                        Design decision aiding system for advising on security choices. Implement and test the system.

                    </td>
                    <td style="">Software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to computer networking that allows
                        network administrators to manage network services through abstraction of lower-level
                        functionality. This is done by decoupling the system that makes decisions about where traffic is
                        sent (the control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected
                        destination (the data plane). The OpenFlow protocol is a concrete realisation of SDN and enables
                        a central server (controller) to determine the path of network packets through the network of
                        switches. This separation of the control from the forwarding allows for more sophisticated
                        traffic management than is feasible using access control lists and standard routing protocols
                        [1]. Google has deployed OpenFlow-enabled switches and controllers for interconnecting their
                        data centres [2][3].


                        This project is about developing an automatic analysis tool that takes an SDN controller program
                        as input and
                        approximates which kind of packets are affected by it and which kind of packets it is sensitive
                        to, e.g. for which packets the order in which it receives them changes its behaviour. This
                        information can then be used in a verification tool developed by Klimis, Parisis and Reus at our
                        department (a paper not yet published will be available) based on, and largely extending, [4].
                        The tool shall then be tested with SDN controller programs (that need to be resourced from the
                        internet)

                    <td style="">The perceptual loss [1] was introduced as a heuristic mechanism for measuring distances
                        between images in a manner that is more similar to how humans do, i.e. with some understanding
                        of semantic content rather than purely pixelwise error. This was later formalised in more detail
                        by [2]. Although effective, these measures are not trivial to draw samples from, and accordingly
                        we cannot visualise the set of images that are regarded as “close” to any other. Works such as
                        [3] provide some means to understand this, however due to the flexibility of the representation
                        the space of images cannot be easily characterized.

                        This project will build an disentangled probabilistic model for measuring the distance between
                        images, where recent work on modelling structured multivariate Gaussian distributions [4] will
                        provide a means of assessing texture similarity.

                    <td style="">Meshes provide an efficient mechanism for sparsely defining information across a
                        domain. In the case of 2D image warping, triangular meshes can be used to sparsely define a warp
                        only at mesh vertices. This enables operations to be applied at high resolutions.

                        This project will build a triangular mesh warper in TensorFlow, PyTorch or Jax, which is fully
                        differentiable. This will allow it to be used in learned computer graphics applications such as
                        [1], and could be used to improve the realism of traditional computer graphics warping
                        approaches [2][3]. Subsequent work will investigate formulation for the optimal triangulation
                        for an image to also be learned without supervision.

                    <td style="">In this project, we will build on the technology of Ultraleap: the worldwide leader for
                        mid-air haptics.
                        Ultraleap produces an ultrasonic board, programmable in C#, which can be used to create shapes
                        at a distance of up to 2m, with a precision that decreases with distance.
                        The idea is to use acoustic metamaterials (i.e. 3D printed materials, designed at Sussex) to
                        prolong the range of interaction of UltraLeap technology so that it will be possible to create
                        well-defined shapes at larger distances - e.g. on the scale of a sitting room.
                        In the long term, this would enable a tangible television where 3D images are mixed with touch.

                        proposal, your selection will be rejected.</td>

                    <td style="">3D printing using polymer plastics is now widely used. Yet documentaries like Blue
                        Planet have highlighted the great cost that plastic pollution has on our environment. By reusing
                        waste that would usually end up in landfill we can reduce that impact and save money spent on
                        buying new printable materials.

                        The aim of this project is to build a device that can be used to create 3D printable filaments
                        made from recycled/low-quality plastics – a “filament factory” [1]. This will be completed by
                        melting low-quality plastics and extruding them to create our in-house filaments. This setup
                        will require the student to build and code a controllable system that will allow them to easily
                        change the method of melting and extruding the filament. The facility setup by this project not
                        only has the potential publication possibilities but will allow parallel projects, that
                        currently use shop-bought materials, to print 3D devices that shape sound using “green”
                        materials.

                        The project will be organized and managed by Dr Gianluca Memoli and Dr Thomas J. Graham.

                    <td style="">Returning to a location using visual cues is an important capability for many animals
                        as well as autonomous robots. View-based homing has therefore received much attention in recent
                        years. At Sussex, we have developed a world-leading route navigation algorithm based on the
                        behaviour of ants <a
                            href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002336"

                        </a> project, the long-term goal of this research is to understand how small-brained animals can
                        explore and navigate complex natural environments and to use this information to develop
                        algorithms for long-distance, outdoor robotic navigation.

                        I am interested in supervising projects in this area which develop and test new variants of the
                        familiarity based navigation algorithm described in [1]. In this algorithm, visual information
                        from a training route is input to a neural network which learns the familiarity of the training
                        data. To subsequently navigate, the agent performs a stereotypical movement during which it
                        samples multiple different viewing directions. Images from these directions are input into the
                        network and the agent moves in the direction deemed most familiar.

                        There are many ways in which the algorithm could be adapted but three areas that could be
                        investigated are:

                        1. Visual processing: eg A comparison of which visual features are most reliable for navigation
                        (in insect or natural habitats). For this it would be good to have done some computer
                        vision/image processing

                        2. The route encoding: eg comparing different ANNs or even a different way of learning the data.
                        For this it would be good to have done some Machine Learning

                        3. The stereotypical movements used to gather the training data or in navigating: eg Active
                        vision for exploration and learning based on learning flights/learning walks (movements
                        bees/ants do when leaving their nest). Sinusoidal movements for sampling different headings

                        Interested students should read [1] as background.

                        Students are also encouraged to suggest their own topics in this area, or to select topics

                    <td style="">In recent decades, academic positions/promotions and research funding depend largely on
                        researchers producing large numbers of “papers” as an indicator of work produced. The quality of
                        such papers is often irrelevant to the outcome. Because of this incentive structure, as text
                        generation methods improve there is substantial risk that scientific literatures will be overrun
                        with entirely synthetic papers produced by paper mills and published in for-profit predatory
                        journals. How can we detect such generated, “fake” content? Especially in the “softer” sciences?
                        What should happen to papers classified as “fake”? This project would involve building or
                        augmenting scientific paper generators and training classifiers to distinguish between selected
                        “real” and “fake” papers, then ideally applying the tool in the “wild” to some degree.

                        <p>The goal of this project is to develop a game to assess humans' ability to infer the mental
                            states of others. Previous work [1] has used a hide-and-seek game, wherein the participant
                            chooses one of two places to search for their opponent. The hiding place of the opponent is
                            governed by simulated agents with varying degrees of theory of mind (e.g. [1,2,3]). Here, an
                            artificial agent with no theory of mind would have some bias towards hiding in one or
                            another location and the player would simply have to learn that bias, which does not require
                            theory of mind either. A more complicated scenario occurs when the artificial agent learns
                            the bias of the human player and hides accordingly. Here then, the human player needs to
                            infer "where the artificial agent thinks they will search", which does require theory of
                            mind.</p>

                        <p>This project will involve creating a web-based game - hide and seek or similar - where the
                            (artificial) hider's behaviour is governed by the models described in [1,2,3]. There are
                            then various options, depending on your interests:

                    <td style="">With the rapid development of 5G communication systems, the advancements of vehicular
                        communication technology in assisting Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can effectively
                        improve passengers’ safety and provide infotainment for enjoyable journeys. There have been
                        significant advancements in electronics aiding car drivers, along with communications outside
                        the vehicle, e.g., vehicle-to-everything (V2X), to enable mobile Internet and entertainment.
                        Together with V2X connectivity, data collected from infrastructure Road Side Units and various
                        other sensors placed on roads, buildings and pedestrians, which constitute the Internet of
                        Vehicles (IoVs), could be disseminated to the vehicle cloud hence ensuring efficient emergency
                        warning notifications, the management of the city traffic levels, and provide drivers with
                        congestion control information.

                        However, security is a key challenge in ITS for IoVs since, nowadays, there exist a plethora of
                        security attacks that can negatively impact its reliability [1]. Some examples of common threats
                        to vehicles in ITS include denial of service, jamming, man in the middle, Sybil, eavesdropping,
                        and broadcast and message tampering.

                        The volume of data required by connected vehicles in IoVs will continue to rise, and some of the
                        appealing content vehicle dissemination applications are of upmost importance for the correct
                        functioning of vehicles [2].

                        The aim of this project is to devise a secure content dissemination scheme leveraging on proxy
                        re-encryption schemes [3] to avoid attackers from tampering with critical data that would
                        endanger vehicles’ passengers.

                        However, the amount of data required for novel vehicular applications such as multimedia content
                        sharing will continue to increase along with the need to minimize latency as a result of an
                        increasing number of connected vehicles as well as more evolved use cases [1]. Although, the use
                        of 5G mobile technology enables broad coverage and high bandwidth to provide multimedia content
                        downloading services for the moving vehicles, even though most probably being overloaded and
                        congested especially during peak times and in urban central areas with the increase of the
                        services and user demands. Consequently, such networks will face extreme performance hits in
                        terms of low network bandwidth, missed calls, and unreliable coverage. However, the
                        opportunistic contacts enabled by V2X communications can provide high bandwidth for the
                        transmission of data as well as enable vehicles to build relationships with other objects they
                        might come into contact with.

                        The aim of this project is to devise a novel content dissemination scheme leveraging on
                        efficient caching mechanisms in-network (i.e., through information-centric networking [2], [3])
                        or at the edge of 5G networks [4].

                        <p>Transformer models such as BERT offer state-of-the-art performance on document classification
                            problems. One drawback of such models, however, is that they are limited to documents of up
                            to 512 tokens. </p>

                        <p>While this is adequate for many scenarios, e.g. the classification of tweets, there are
                            situations where this presents a problem, e.g. the classification of news articles.</p>

                        <p>It is possible to break up a long document into suitably sized chunks and classify each one
                            separately, before producing an overall classification of the whole document based on the
                            class of each of the chunks. There are, however, problems with this approach, in particular:
                            how best to combine the decisions on each of the chunks to produce a decision for the whole
                            document; how to handle the fact that the labelled data used to train the classifier will
                            not provide chunk level labels, but document level labels. </p>

                        <p>In this project you will explore the effectiveness of approaches to this problem, considering
                            a variety of different datasets and types of classification problems.</p>

                    <td style="">Monitoring, understanding, and predicting the integrity of our planetary biosphere is
                        the most critical sustainability issue of our time. The emerging science of Ecoacoustics enables
                        the exciting possibility to eavesdrop on ecosystems to assess their health [1]. Reconstruction
                        learning has proven effective at generating ecologically meaningful soundscape representations
                        when trained entirely on the magnitude component of the discrete Fourier transform. However
                        audible interpretation of network outputs remains challenging while reconstructions are missing
                        the phase component. Signal reconstruction from magnitude-only measurements presents a
                        long-standing problem in signal processing [2,3]. Reconstructions of soundscape audio using
                        standard iterative algorithms for phase estimation are often noisy or retain artefacts which
                        preclude the possibility of reliably interpreting audible features in an ecoacoustic context.
                        Listening back to high resolution reconstructions would allow ecologists to have a much better
                        insight into predictions made using learned latent acoustic features. This project will
                        investigate how self-supervised machine learning architectures can approximate the phase
                        component of a DFT to render high resolution reconstructions of ecosystem audio recordings.
                        This project is in collaboration with Kieran Gibb and Ivor Simpson and feeds into existing
                        research at Sussex into cutting edge research in learning ecologically meaningful soundscape
                        representations for inference. This builds on the work of a previous masters project in summer
                        2022 that established an initial codebase for reconstructing magnitude spectrograms.

                        to instruction in mathematics and science using novel diagrammatic notations, topics including:
                        algebra, probability theory, circuit electricity, syllogistic logic, set theory, and
                        propositional logic (<a href="http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~peterch/ChengPapers.html"

                        intelligent tutoring system could use these diagrams by, for instance, presenting the learner
                        with an example in the conventional notation of the chosen topic (e.g., algebraic equations) for
                        which the student would produce an equivalent expression in the novel diagrammatic notation. The
                        aim of this project is to develop the core engine of such an intelligent tutoring system, that
                        will be delivered in web-browser. The function of the AI engine is to compare given expressions
                        in the conventional notation with target examples in the novel diagrammatic notation, in order
                        to test whether the solutions generated by students are correct. The project will require the
                        design and implementation of: knowledge representations to encode the conventional and novel
                        diagrammatic notations; methods to test whether the expressions in the knowledge representations
                        are same; techniques to extract descriptions of why the diagrammatic expressions are invalid.

                    <td style="">While Machine Learning (ML) and particularly Deep Learning (DL) have conquered world
                        champions in many games once thought to be too complex for computers, (from Chess to Go [1-2]),
                        some games are still remain beyond the reach of machine intelligence. One such game is Terra
                        Mystica, a full information strategy board game, which has resisted engineering efforts to
                        enhance the AI with Deep Learning due to the number of players, the size of the state space and
                        the random initial configuration [3].

                        While developing a full Terra Mystica AI agent is beyond the scope of this project, the most
                        crucial move in the game tends to be the choice of faction during the setup which strongly
                        depends upon the random initial configuration of round bonuses. A wealth of historic game data
                        has been collected at a free web-based adaption [4] for games spanning several years.

                        The aim of this project is to predict trends over time in the meta-game i.e. choice of faction
                        according to the current popular faction choices in tournaments.

                    <td style="">Predictive Coding is an influential model for explaining how the brain can approximate
                        Bayesian inference in order to carry out perception. A common approach is to train a
                        Hierarchical Predictive Coding Network (PCN) to generate observations from latent variables (eg
                        MNIST images from MNIST labels). Perception then involves running an iterative inference process
                        to infer the label for a single presented image.
                        However, rather than providing labels in training, it is also possible to train in an
                        unsupervised manner - in this case, clustering or PCA analysis of the inferred latent variables
                        shows that they are still separable into distinct groups for each of the 10 MNIST images types
                        (see [1] for a review of PC). This is important as it means that every interaction with world
                        can be a learning experience, not just labelled interactions. Furthermore, we don't evolve to
                        perceive - we evolve to act. And the inferred labels from such a network can then be used as the
                        input to a second network to select actions with high accuracy.
                        Separate from this, we have shown in [2] that if we train a Hierarchical PCN in an unsupervised
                        manner and present action alongside observation at the "bottom" of the network then it can learn
                        to control that action based on the presented observation. Importantly, such a PCN distributes
                        learning throughout the network, with higher layers called into use only as required. However,
                        the nature of this single network approach means that the accuracy of action selection is
                        relatively poor.
                        This project will build on the work of [2] and investigate whether other network structures
                        which fall in between the two-network approach and the single network approach of [2] can lead
                        to higher performance of action selection.

                    <td style="">Optical frequency combs are an advanced class of lasers emitting ultra-precise pulses
                        of light [1]. They are ideal candidates to provide the fast-beating “optical heart” required by
                        transformative technologies such as portable atomic clocks, highly-sensitive hazardous chemical
                        detectors, wearable devices for high-precision medical diagnostics, and computer chips operating
                        at photonics speeds.

                        Despite recent technological breakthroughs, frequency combs remain surprisingly hard to control
                        and stabilise at the high emission powers required by real-life applications. This is because
                        existing linear analysis techniques are poorly suited to modeling highly nonlinear states, which
                        limits our access to the extensive range of potential emission regimes. Recent results have
                        demonstrated the vast potential of Machine Learning (ML) in stabilising lasers, delivering
                        improved emission performance (e.g. higher pulse intensity) in a fraction of the time required
                        by standard techniques [2]. In the case of a frequency comb laser, for example, a deep-learning
                        model could iteratively learn to “predict” which combination of input parameters can improve the
                        laser emission. Driving and maintaining a micro-comb laser into an arbitrary high-energy state,
                        however, is elusive and requires a more advanced approach merging AI predictions with a precise
                        understanding of the system’s internal nonlinear dynamics, not necessarily known a priori. This
                        task eludes standard techniques and requires developing an entirely new conceptual approach to
                        tackle real-life laser dynamics.

                        This interdisciplinary project (with Dr Juan Totero Gongora in Physics) aims to overcome this
                        conceptual gap. You will investigate extending an existing approach [3] for characterising and
                        controlling a real-life ultrafast laser using variational auto encoders and LSTMs trained on
                        simulated laser outputs. This project follows on from a successful MSc dissertation in this
                        area, with several areas of interest to explore depending on the students interests.

                    <td style="">There is growing interest among certain groups of psychology researchers in
                        understanding whether and how human behaviour, particularly emotional processing and action,
                        varies with the cardiac (heartbeat) cycle. For example, some researchers have examined whether
                        eye movements are more likely to occur at certain times after the last heartbeat.

                        We recently developed some statistical tests and a simple accompanying MATLAB toolbox for
                        preprocessing, analysing, and visualising these kinds of data. The target audience here was
                        psychology researchers who are not confident in programming or statistics, and the idea was to
                        make the toolbox as easy to use as possible.

                        such person falls under the category A or A&amp;B (e.g., “a teacher” vs. “a teacher who likes
                        reading”). The project lends itself to multiple ways of tackling the influence of semantic,
                        social and gender-related biases in LMs. It will require a part of data collection (human
                        annotation of existing data), designing strategies to query LMs for probability estimation, and
                        comparing such predictions against human judgments. Possibly, an investigation of the decision
                        process followed by the model.

                    <td style="">Recently there have been some attempts to apply modern NLP / machine learning
                        techniques to traditional logical/mathematical reasoning tasks, e.g., simple arithmetic or
                        Boolean formula satisfiabilty. A recent work, which applies the Transformer architecture to the
                        problem of finding solutions to temporal logic formulas, can be found at the link below:

                        The goal of the project is to advance the state of the art by applying similar techniques to
                        more expressive temporal logics (e.g., with timing constraints). It is likely that the result
                        will degrade as the formulas will be more complicated, thus it is also expected that one needs
                        some novel ideas to improve the performance.

                    <td style="">Quantifying cell properties from microscopy images is an integral part of experimental
                        cell biology. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of multi-channel imaging for measuring
                        progression through the cell-cycle [1]. Such data can be used to quantify differences between
                        different cell-lines, which could be used to measure the effects of genetic changes.

                        This project has two directions that could be investigated:
                        Improvements to cell segmentation models using semi-supervised learning: Recent works have
                        created general purpose machine learning approaches for labelled the pixels of cells [2,3].
                        However, due to the diversity of appearance and cells overlapping these may fail in some
                        situations. One route this project could take is leveraging a small quantity of labelled images
                        of the target cells and many unlabelled images (or videos) to improve the segmentation
                        performance [4, 5].
                        Learning the statistical relationships between the different image channel information through a
                        generative model, such as a variational autoencoder [6]. This may lead to a representation that
                        enables more reliable classification of cell-cycle stages. It also enables analysis of how
                        observing the cell in one image channel can predict the other channels [7], which may enable
                        subsequent optimisation of the acquisition process.

                    <td style="">Eye-movement data is being increasingly used for research in cognitive science and for
                        the design of interfaces in HCI. However, the interpretation of eye-movement data is a real
                        challenge, because scan paths are complex and dynamic. Existing commercial tools largely provide

                        Some cybersecurity issues where ML can use:

                        - Identification and prevention of malware
                        Sophos' recent product, Intercept X, uses deep learning techniques for this purpose.
                        Some researchers have successfully used transfer learning techniques.
                        - Identification of vulnerabilities in application coding
                        ML models have been trained on vulnerabilities like SQL injection, CSRF and XSS

                        - Insider threat.
                        Insider threat is the most challenging task for computer security professionals to deal with.
                        Some scholars think ML has a solution for it.

                    </td>
                    <td style="">The number of vehicles has been increasing due to the rapid development and
                        industrialization. This large number of vehicles has led to a significant number of issues such
                        as traffic congestions, traffic accidents, and environmental pollution. The problem caused by an
                        increasing number of vehicles has led automotive manufacturers to use information and
                        communication technology to improve users’ experience and safety by coordinating human, vehicle
                        and the environment [1]. Autonomous vehicles’ main goal is safety, comfort and the prompt
                        delivery of its occupants with minimum impact on the environment [2]. These vehicles should also
                        be able to communicate with each other as well as with handheld devices carried by pedestrians,
                        roadside units, and the public networks using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity, which
                        corresponds to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A huge amount of data is also foreseen in IoV
                        networks usually driven by the development of new vehicle applications such as vehicular
                        telematics, infotainment, and intelligent transportation services.

                        The security of an IoV network has been a major concern to researchers since it is an open
                        network that anyone can join. Given the dynamic nature of IoVs, there is a need for data
                        security to prevent malicious attacks such as denial of service (DoS), jamming, man in the
                        middle, Sybil, eavesdropping, and broadcast and message tampering, which may lead to physical
                        damages and privacy issues [3]. The latter incentivized the researcher community to come up with
                        different architectures.

                        Three possible cloud networks exist in IoVs, namely vehicular cloud, edge cloud, and Internet
                        cloud. In a vehicular cloud, vehicles group themselves into clusters based on their geographical
                        locations. A cluster head sends data to other cluster heads and to the edge cloud. These data
                        can also be sent by the edge cloud to the Internet cloud for further processing. The cluster
                        head is responsible for aggregating data sent by its vehicles, besides confirming its integrity.
                        What if the cluster head is compromised?

                        The aim of this project is to design a novel smart monitoring system at the edge cloud to sense
                        malicious behaviors such as DoS attacks, identity spoofing attacks, and data spoofing in the
                        vehicle cloud. The system will be a lightweight machine learning algorithm placed at the edge to
                        analyze network traffic. The algorithm should be trained to learn normal network functioning and
                        detect anomalies (e.g., [4]).

                    <td style="">The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of cell surface molecules encoded
                        by a large gene family which controls a major part of the immune system in all vertebrates. The
                        major function of MHCs is to bind to peptide fragments derived from pathogens and display them
                        on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells.
                        This project is in co-operation with the Immunology Department of our Medical School.
                        There will be several task according to how things go.


                        Develop a technique to cluster the various aminoacid sequences of the (MHC) antigenes of the
                        entire set of an HLA-locus or a subgroup of those (as e.g. given by a group of patients). Then
                        visualise those amino acid sequences in various ways. The visualisation should be non-trivial
                        and interactive, 2D and 3D is possible.

                        This project needs a student who is interested in Biology/Immunology but does not have to know
                        much about it as long as he/she is willing to learn enough to proceed with the (bioinformatics)
                        tasks at hand. This means the student must be motivated and willing to learn something new. The
                        student should ideally also have some experience in Machine Learning and be a good programmer.

                    <td style="">Over the past decade, Deep neural networks have achieved highly impressive perceptual
                        feats. In particular, convolutional neural networks have surpassed humans in their ability to
                        classify naturalistic images. These findings, together with their similarities in architecture
                        and activity patterns, have sparked major renewed interest in DNNs as models of the brain.
                        However, these models diverge from human perceptual abilities in important and unexpected ways,
                        e.g., through their weakness to noise, susceptibility to adversarial attacks and inability to
                        recognise stylised representations. This has been shown to be due to their over-reliance on
                        diagnostic but brittle features such as texture [1] or even a single pixel correlated with the
                        image class [2]. Some of these shortcomings have been addressed through incorporating more of
                        the properties of the primate visual system into these models [3] or by using more extensive and
                        naturalistic training regimes [4].

                        The aim of this project is to reduce the precision of the model to make it less reliant on fine
                        details, more robust to noise and better able to generalise.

                    <td style="">This project looks into:
                        • How the lack of robustness of research models may have contributed to
                        the current issues that psychology and social sciences are experiencing with
                        replicability and credibility
                        • We’ve already conducted a couple of studies to see whether researchers attend to the
                        statistical assumptions of their models and related issues with robustness, and the
                        general conclusion is: they don’t and when they do, they only rarely detect any real
                        problems - not because the problems aren’t there but because they are using
                        inappropriate methods.

                        Aims of the study:
                        • We want to get a fairly comprehensive overview of the reported statistical practice
                        around the models used by pulling information out of papers published in the
                        past 10 years.
                        • The kinds of things we want to know, include:
                        - What kind of models are typically applied and how has this changed over the
                        years?
                        - How often do researchers use robust models instead of OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) models?
                        - For OLS models, how often are assumption checks and outliers checks reported?
                        What kind of methods are being used to deal with potential problems?</td>

                        1. Develop a learning framework to create descriptive features of spontaneous synaptic activity.
                        2. Investigate machine learning model choices for classifying candidate events
                        3. Compare the performance (Receiver Operating Characteristics, ROC) with earlier software
                        versions over a range of problem data sets

                        Description. Neurons receive inputs from thousands of other neurons at connections called
                        chemical synapses. Measuring synaptic activity is an instrumental step to understanding how
                        neurons encode and process information. Dr Penn’s lab recently developed and released the first
                        version of some open source software, Eventer [1,2], as a machine learning solution for the
                        challenge of classifying candidate spontaneous synaptic events measured by electrophysiology or
                        imaging and detected by deconvolution [3]. The accurate detection and classification of
                        spontaneous synaptic activity is particularly difficult when events occur frequently and their
                        waveforms are overlapping; a problem often associated with in vivo recordings. Currently,
                        training the software requires manual classification and uses a set of hand-crafted features
                        extracted from a training data set as input to a Random Forests algorithm. The software serves
                        as a framework to use machine learning as solution for improving consistency and automating the
                        correct identification of synaptic events.

                        The purpose of this MSc project is to develop a data-driven framework for creating sets of
                        general-purpose descriptive features that enable accurate classification of candidate synaptic
                        events. These features will be used in downstream machine learning models and could be used to
                        make an improved version of the Eventer tool. The types of features to consider could include
                        convolutional filters of the raw signal or spectrogram. These features will be learned from
                        example datasets using either a fully-supervised or semi-supervised learning paradigm. The
                        resulting feature sets will be used to train and evaluate classifiers on a range of challenging
                        data sets from our lab and from online data archives (e.g. DANDI). The existing toolkit is in
                        MATLAB, and developments would need to be compatible with this. However, Python frameworks (e.g.
                        PyTorch and TensorFlow) could still be used for learning the features, which could then be
                        translated into MATLAB.

                        This project is in collaboration with Dr Andrew Penn (life sciences)

                        <p>Language models have advanced rapidly in recent years, with OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model
                            capable of generating natural language text that can be difficult to distinguish from
                            human-authored texts. The student(s) will examine the limitations and opportunities of
                            current language models, and formulate a dissertation project around the development of a
                            new application/tool within this space.</p>

                        <p>Areas that could be explored include: sustaining coherence over longer outputs; creating
                            stories with beginnings, middles and ends; enriching generated stories with knowledge of
                            worlds or settings; multimedia storytelling incorporating imagery and sound; training with
                            smaller text corpora (e.g. languages other than English); location-specific storytelling
                            using geolocation data; distinguishing generated texts from human-authored texts; applying
                            text generation within games, immersive storytelling, or other interactive media contexts;
                            addressing biases embedded in training data (e.g. racism); developing tools to evaluate
                            specific social and ethic risks of new language models; enabling more human oversight and
                            input during text generation; developing machine-human collaboration interfaces
                            incorporating generated text; developing more sustainable and less energy-intensive
                            approaches to text generation; developing countermeasures against possible abuses of
                            language models (e.g. extremism, fraud); improving text generation for specific genres or
                            kinds of texts. Other topics related to NLP can also be considered.</p>

                    <td style="">Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzhiemer's, are known to have heterogeneous
                        presentation across populations. This can complicate differential diagnosis between various
                        forms of dementia, and predicting how a patient's state may degrade over time.

                        This project will use a public dataset[1,2] containing neurological biomarkers to build machine
                        learning models, such as [3,4,5], that predict disease state/progression give a set of
                        measurements. You will investigate methods to quantify the uncertainty of predictions and better
                        understand population variability.

                    <td style="">This project will examine imaging data acquired from two-photon calcium microscopy in
                        mice brains; the experimental setup is described in [1]. The data reflect activity of individual
                        neurons recorded while mice perform a trained sensory-guided behaviour. The ultimate aim is to
                        understand how neurons respond to sensory and behavioural variables as the mouse interacts with
                        its environment. This data has two analysis challenges: firstly the observed image data has a
                        low temporal sampling frequency (~10Hz) and its relationship with neuronal activations is not a
                        straightforward linear function; secondly, neuronal activations are likely to correlate both
                        with sensory stimuli under the control of the experimenter, and potentially with actions of the
                        mouse and other factors. This makes disentangling neuronal activations related to the stimulus
                        challenging without incorporating observations of confounding factors. The project could lead to
                        publishable insights into how groups of neurons collectively predict stimuli and other
                        variables.

                        Depending on the students’ interest, this project could investigate two directions of study:
                        Develop a multivariate model for predicting stimuli given the simultaneously imaged signal from
                        sets of neurons. This approach would investigate a combination of temporal feature engineering
                        and/or learning, to independently interpret the signal at each neuron, in combination with a
                        regularised linear classifier to provide interpretability in terms of neuronal contribution.
                        Build an implementation of a variational autoencoder for probabilistic spike inference spikes
                        from calcium imaging data following a similar approach to [2]. Subsequently, the dataset can be
                        re-analysed using the predicted spikes.

                        This project is in collaboration with Professor Miguel Maravall (Life Sciences).

                    <td style="">The processes that control the writing behaviours (at a time scale of 1s) have until
                        recently been mysterious. What are the processes that are involved in the transformation of
                        memory structures into sequences that can be generated as a succession of pen strokes? Cheng
                        &amp; van Genutchen (2018) logged the behaviour of 32 people, at millisecond resolution, as they
                        wrote multiple memorised sentences. Surprisingly, the analysis of the performance data
                        identified seventeen different writing strategies. A mechanism for interleaving parallel
                        processes of memory retrieval and stroke making actions was proposed that explains the diverse
                        strategies. The aim of this project is to build a computational cognitive model that simulates
                        the different writing strategies in order to test the proposed mechanisms of control. Options
                        for the implementation language, include: (a) ACT-R, the leading cognitive modelling

                        champions in many games once thought to be too complex for computers, (from Chess to Go [1-2]),
                        some games are still remain beyond the reach of machine intelligence. One such game is Terra
                        Mystica, a full information strategy board game, which has resisted engineering efforts to
                        enhance the AI with Deep Learning due to the number of players, the size of the state space and
                        the random initial configuration [3].

                        While developing a full Terra Mystica AI agent is beyond the scope of this project, the most
                        crucial move in the game tends to be the choice of faction during the setup which strongly
                        depends upon the random initial configuration of round bonuses. A wealth of historic game data
                        has been collected at a free web-based adaption [4] for games spanning several years.

                        The aim of this project is to process these historic games to train a DL/ML model to serve as a
                        faction recommender based on previously successful choices.

                        will find evidence supporting the fake fact that we are checking. If I search for “vaccines are
                        bad for you”, the top results will be about side effects and adverse effects whereas if I search
                        for “vaccines are good for you” – the top results are about the benefits of vaccines. This
                        project will look at rewording potential facts as queries or neutral statements designed to
                        return more balanced results.

                    <td style="">For many years, the design of acoustic experiences has relied on electronics.
                        Synthetisers and mixers have become essential tools for designing music, games and sonic art.
                        The advent of acoustic metamaterials has changed this: they are passive devices and embed part
                        of the processing within their geometry. In 2017, a team of Sussex researchers found that
                        metamaterials can be designed starting from 16 basic units, a.k.a. “bricks” [1]. This has highly
                        simplified the design, but the absence of analytical methods to describe the performance of a
                        brick has not allowed optimisation to take over. Until now. A recently published paper [2] shows
                        how to calculate the analytically effect of a metamaterial brick in terms of phase and
                        intensity. The problem “given a certain geometry constraint, which brick is best for the scope?”
                        can now be resolved in terms of optimisation. The interested candidate will be invited to
                        consider suitable approaches for this optimisation problem. A suggestion is Genetic Algorithms,
                        and more specifically, so-called Illuminative Algorithms [3]. Whereas standard GAs typically
                        focus on finding one high-fitness solution (and therefore very susceptible to issues such as
                        early convergence), Illuminative Algorithms [4] aim to produce diverse solutions with high
                        fitness. Particularly relevant to the problem at hand, QD algorithms operate typically in the
                        behavioural (feature space) rather than the genotypic space. A possibly relevant example of use
                        of QD is available in [5], incidentally, first-authored by a former Sussex MSc student.

                        This project will involve supervision by both Dr Gianluca Memoli and Prof Luc Berthouze.

                        Intuitively, it's like writing programs by directly manipulating the internal data structure, so
                        we don't have to deal with syntax to describe it.

                        There are three possible projects on this topic:

                        Variant 1: Interaction nets compiler

                        The graphical programming language can be compiled into executable
                        code in a number of different ways. A strong interest in compilers is
                        essential for this project. Comparative Programming will be very
                        useful also.

                        Variant 2: Haskell to interaction nets

                        Define a small subset of the functional programming language Haskell,
                        write a parser, and then a code generator for the interaction nets
                        language. If time allows there are some compiler optimisations and
                        benchmark comparisons that could be investigated.

                        Variant 3: Graphical editor

                        Writing graphical programs requires an editor where we can directly
                        input the graphical representation of programs. A number of possible
                        directions can be taken, including program layout (how to best
                        visualise a program and automatically draw in the correct orientation),
                        animation of algorithms, and several others. Please contact me to
                        discuss your interests.

                        Description
                        Planning algorithms are a cornerstone of model-based reinforcement learning [1,2], and there are
                        a number of currently existing algorithms and implementations. However, there has been
                        relatively little detailed comparisons of the performance and robustness of these methods in the
                        literature. In this project you would build on and contribute to a toolbox of state-of-the-art
                        planning algorithms for reinforcement learning and perform controlled experiments to
                        scientifically determine their performance characteristics under reproducible conditions.

                    <td style="">Our experience of time often deviates from “clock time” – exemplified in common sayings
                        such as “time flies when you’re having fun” or “a watched pot never boils”. Think of how
                        different time is when you are bored, waiting for an appointment, versus on holiday with
                        friends. Despite these clear and obvious aspects of experience, the most common approaches in
                        neuroscience and psychology in recent decades have searched for an “internal clock” that tracks
                        objective time precisely – like the system clock of a computer. We recently demonstrated an
                        alternative approach by examining the dynamics of activity in an artificial neural network (deep
                        convolutional neural network), and found that with a simple algorithm, we could match human
                        reports of subjective time (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08194-7" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08194-7</a>). We have extended
                        this work using human neuroimaging to show that the same fundamental approach works on real
                        neural activity also (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.09.900423" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.09.900423</a>). However, in both
                        these cases, while working with more naturalistic stimulation than typically used in the field
                        (real first person videos recorded walking around different environments), the stimuli were
                        always silent videos.

                        One idea would be to examine whether we can apply the same principles that we have found to be
                        effective in modelling human subjective time based on vision only to cases of audition only, and
                        ultimately the combination of audio and visual stimulation (such as in real videos, tv, movies,
                        etc). This would involve using a similar neural network approach to that we previously used and
                        seeing how effective it can be, matched to real human judgements. It would require finding
                        appropriate auditory (and multisensory) stimuli to use in the experiments, building models base
                        on existing architectures, testing human participants on the same stimuli, and comparing
                        outcomes of the two.

                        Another idea would be to look at whether the performance of the network regarding time
                        perception depends on the performance of the image classification portions. E.g. whether
                        different training for image classification, such as using more natural image sets changes
                        performance. Or whether different architectures that are more or less biologically reasonable
                        (<a href="https://www.brain-score.org" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.brain-score.org</a>) influence time estimation
                        performance.

                        One final idea, related to another project outline, would be to do some of the above, but with a
                        focus on accessibility. So one possibility would be to develop some minimal web architecture
                        where people could dump videos that they want human-like estimates of duration for, with
                        different options in terms of base classification network or other model features (this would be
                        limited by accessibility of these networks on the given platform). The project would involve
                        initial implementation and then some interesting demonstrations of how this could be used for
                        research (these demonstrations should be targets of new empirical interest). This kind of
                        framework would allow other researchers to easily investigate their hypotheses within our model
                        framework.</td>

                    <td style="">The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have triggered enormous shocks to the global
                        economy, and it is challenging to understand how governments’ economic policy should respond.
                        Governments initially provided a lot of stimulus to protect livelihoods, yet there is a danger
                        now that rising inflation is leading to a harmful choking off of credit, both public and
                        private. This project will explore two recent comprehensive databases produced by the World
                        Bank, on inflation [1] and on government finances (referred to as "fiscal space") [2], covering
                        over 190 countries. Data science / machine learning will be applied to understand the dynamics
                        of different measures of inflation at the national and international level, and the relation to
                        public and private debt dynamics. See [3] for a previous historical case-study on Canada, and
                        [4] for a paper on applications of machine learning at the Bank of England.

                        the data is wrong. The HLA complex (the human MHC) is hugely polymorphic and as a result HLA
                        differences between groups have to be expected unless groups are very large. HLA-alleles are
                        inherited as haplotypes, i.e. one set of alleles from each parent, however, HLA-typing cannot
                        identify haplotypes (i.e. the set that was inherited from one or the other parents). This makes
                        it difficult to compare haplotypes. One possible way of comparing groups in regards to HLA-type,
                        however, is via the presence/frequency of individual HLA-Alleles in the two groups.

                                allele-frequencies. The user can select two groups of patients from the large underlying
                                data set to perform frequency analysis (odds-ratio etc) based on HLA types of patients
                                in two different groups, including statistical relevance of the differences. Allele
                                frequencies should be visualised in nice diagrams highlighting statistically relevant
